GETTING AND CLEANING DATA- PROJECT 1 SUBMISSION

=========================================================================================

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
Dataset is downloaded from site: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Following files are used in order to achieve the goal of creating two tidy datasets

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


=========================================
tidydataset1
=========================================
tidydataset1 comprise of 79 columns that represent mean, standard deviation and meanfreq columns from the merged data of test and train raw dataset. And column subject and activity.

=========================================
tidydataset2
=========================================
tidydataset2 comprise of total of 81 columns: 79 columns for each combination of subject / activity representing the average of each of the columns from tidydataset1.
In addition the first two columns are subject and activity names. In total it has a total of 30*6=180 rows representing each combination of subject& activity name.


The project submission includes the following files:
=========================================


1.  'README.md'
2.  'CodeBook.md'- The study design, mapping of raw data to tidy data variable names that represent mean, standard deviation & frequency mean and  tidy data set variable names and its description are provided in this document.
3.  'run_analysis.R' - R script to read the raw dataset and create tidy dataset. And using the tidy dataset create another dataset with the average of the 79 variables
4. 'tidydataset2.txt'-  Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
